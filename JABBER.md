## Plugins that do not work:
- bitcoin (color codes)
- drama
- google (gis seems fine)
- stock (color codes)
- tag (we do not escape special characters for html, such as <)
- tell (showtell uses notice, which we do not yet support)
- tinyurl (some form of html escaping)
- translate (help uses <>)
- urlhistory (something about invalid token)
